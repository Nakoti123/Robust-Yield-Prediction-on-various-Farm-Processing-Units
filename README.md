# Robust-Yield-Prediction-on-various-Farm-Processing-Units

**Problem Description:** A new fast-food chain is seeing rapid expansion over the past couple of years. They are now trying to optimize their supply chain to ensure that there are no shortages of ingredients. For this, theyâ€™ve tasked the data science team to come up with a model that could predict the output of each food processing farm over the next few years. These predictions could further increase the efficiency of their current supply chain management systems

**Objectives:**
1) Explore the data and engieer new features.
2) Predict the yield for each farm during the given timestamps.
3) Given the forecasted demand for the next few months for a particular ingredient, device a strategy to source it, creating a strategy to source 'ing_w' ingredient type.
**The approach for solving the problem.**

**Define the problem:** Understand the business problem and clearly define the objective of the project. This includes defining the problem statement, identifying the target variable.There are 5 datasets provided in this competition. The datasets consist of Crop Information mainly around different types of ingredients, Farm Data and Field Management Information and also consists information of the weather data provided by timestamp.

**Explore the data**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data, its distribution, and any patterns that may exist. This will help in identifying any anomalies or missing data that need to be cleaned.

**Data cleaning and preprocessing**: Prepare the data for modeling by cleaning and preprocessing it. This includes handling missing values, outliers, and dealing with categorical variables.

**Feature engineering:** Create new features or transform existing ones to improve the performance of the model.

**Model selection**: Select the appropriate model that can best solve the problem. This may involve trying multiple algorithms and selecting the one with the highest accuracy.

**Train the model:** Split the data into training and validation sets, and train the model on the training set. This includes tuning the hyperparameters of the model and using techniques like cross-validation to avoid overfitting.

**Evaluate the model:** Evaluate the performance of the model on the validation set. This includes calculating metrics like RMSE. Predictions on the Test Data.

**Conclusion**.The project has successfully demonstrated the use of Random Forest Regression  in the development of Robust Yield Prediction model on a dataset consisting of various parameters related to the obtaining of expected yield.


**I have split this Colab notebook into two parts: the first part covers EDA, data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering; while the second part covers model selection, training, evaluation, and predictions on the test data. This has been done to address memory issues that arise from running all the tasks in a single notebook.**
